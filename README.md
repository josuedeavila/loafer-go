# Loafer Go

Loafer Go is a lightweight Go library designed for high-throughput and concurrent processing of messages from AWS SQS queues and sending to AWS SNS topics.

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **Concurrent Message Consumers** with fixed worker pool size
- ✅ **FIFO Grouped Processing** 
  - Based `MessageGroupId` and custom fields (loafergo.PerGroupID)
  - Parallel (loafergo.Parallel)
- ✅ **SNS Producer** with support for both standard and FIFO topics
- ✅ **SQS Batch Receive and Parallel Handling**
- ✅ **Batched Deletes** (`sqs.RouteWithDeleteBatch`) — up to 10x fewer delete API calls
- ✅ **Simple API** with clean abstractions and interfaces
- ✅ **Test Coverage & Benchmarks**
- ✅ **Fully Configurable** via functional options

## 📦 Installation

```bash
go get -u github.com/justcodes/loafer-go/v2
```

Import into your project:

```go
import "github.com/justcodes/loafer-go/v2"
```

---

## 🚀 Quickstart Example

Start by writing a main application that produces messages to SNS and consumes from SQS.

[example](/example)

---

## 🐳 Local Development (with LocalStack)

Make sure you have Docker installed.

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The init script in `./aws/init-aws.sh` will:

- Create topics (`standard` and `fifo`)
- Create queues
- Subscribe queues to the topics

---

## 🧪 Testing

Run tests:

```bash
make test
```

Run benchmarks:

```bash
make test-bench
```

Install formatters and linters:

```bash
make configure
```

## 📁 Project Structure

- `loafergo/` – Main package code
- `aws/` – AWS configuration, SQS/SNS clients, and route handlers
- `example/` – Sample producer and consumer demonstrating loafergo usage
- `fake/` – Fakes for tests

## 🗑️ Batched Deletes

By default each consumed message costs one `DeleteMessage` call. `sqs.RouteWithDeleteBatch`
groups them into `DeleteMessageBatch` requests of up to 10 entries — the same ceiling as
`MaxNumberOfMessages` — so a full receive cycle collapses into a single delete call:

```go
route := sqs.NewRoute(
    &sqs.Config{SQSClient: client, Handler: handler, QueueName: "example-1"},
    sqs.RouteWithMaxMessages(10),
    sqs.RouteWithDeleteBatch(50*time.Millisecond),
    sqs.RouteWithLogger(logger), // where delete failures are reported
)
```

A batch is flushed as soon as it holds 10 messages **or** the last message of the current
receive cycle is committed, so in the common case no latency is added at all. The linger is
only the safety net for when a slow handler holds the batch back. Measured against
LocalStack with 100 messages: 100 `DeleteMessage` calls become 10 `DeleteMessageBatch`
calls, and a FIFO run of 60 messages across 4 groups got *faster* (528ms → 322ms), since
workers no longer block on a delete round trip.

Two things to know before enabling it:

- **`Commit` becomes asynchronous.** It hands the message to the batcher and returns `nil`
  immediately, so the delete outcome is reported through the route logger instead of being
  returned to the manager.
- **Handlers must be idempotent.** A delete still pending when the process dies means the
  message is redelivered — which is already true of SQS at-least-once delivery, but the
  window is slightly wider. On FIFO queues keep the linger small: SQS will not deliver the
  next message of a `MessageGroupId` while one is still in flight.
